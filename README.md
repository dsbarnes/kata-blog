# Kata Blog
In this blog, I do katas, talk about puzles, algorithms, and
do fun, practiacl programming projects.

## Installation
If you would like to use this blog as a template for your site  
or for whatever else  
  
Begin by cloning this repo,  
change to the project directory and run `yarn install.`  
  
Once finished run `yarn start`  
and the project should run locally on port `3000.`  


## Usage
Once running, navigate to `localhost:3000` in a browser.  
You should see some purple icons and a couple of the first articles
I ever posted.  

The public directory contains only the index.html,  
and the title icon.  

The src directory contains three sub directories  
icons,  
siteData,  
components  

The icons are 100% replaceable. They just look nice on the site.  
The siteData contains `.json` files, and an `index.js` for exporting them.  
The data in these files can be whatever information you would like to display.  

Currently the components are a bit large and need refactoring.  
This is under construction currently and when a finalized version is under way,  
the information in this section will be updated.
